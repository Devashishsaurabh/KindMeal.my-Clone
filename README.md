The Journey:

The Journey so far has been challenging and fun at the same time for my team this was our second project and the deadline was just a week, it all felt like we were working on a real product, and also we tried to enact the overall activity as the real working climate where we used git commands to collaborate throughout the project. The planning, discussions, and other team-relevant activities were done via zoom meetings. Each of us handled different tasks to ensure the successful submission of the project.

Project Details:

We are given a task to make a functional clone website of The World's 1st Meat-Free Lifestyle Platform KindMeal.my. KindMeal.my is a Malaysia startup Founded by Andy K oh in 2008, PetFinder.my has been working hard with nationwide animal shelters, rescuers, and pet lovers to improve Malaysia's animal welfare. Much of our focus was centered upon pets - specifically, dogs and cats (alright, we have rabbits, hamsters, birds, fishes, turtles-, and chickens too). The website has lots of functionalities such as login, signup, Landing-page, Meal Deals, KindMoments, Hot Picks, Recipes, Directory, Articles, Help, etc.
We tried our best to clone the website from scratch based on the knowledge gained from unit-3 of Journey (unit 1–3) at Masai School.  We have imparted the majority of functions that the KindMeal.
